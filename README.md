Module 9 challenge
Columbia Engineering 

In this repo is the work I am submitting for the Module 9 Challenge.

There are 8 documents titles, Query_1 - Query_8, each one of those is a screenshot of the query that was requested in the 8 Data Analysis questions.

Also included is the ERD from QuickDBD as well as the schema that was generated there to create the tables. I could not complete the required addition of the NOT NULL column constrictors in QuickDBD, that was done in pgadmin as ALTER TABLE statements. I copied and pasted the table information once the NOT NULL constrictors was added and I included that as a PDF titled "pgadmin_table_schemas'.

Thanks for reading,
Kat
